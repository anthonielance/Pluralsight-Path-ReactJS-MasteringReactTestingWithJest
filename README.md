# Mastering Reacting Testing with Jest

Author: [Daniel Stern](http://danielstern.ca)

Testing web applications is one of the most important parts of the development process and Jest, the testing framework from the makers of React, is one of the newest and most powerful tools for doing so. In this course, we'll fully implement a suite Jest tests. The course will begin with a detailed overview of the Jest API and several hands on examples demonstrating how it works. Following that, we'll put together a full React application and then test a variety of its components using Jest and React Test Tools. Successful students of this course will be able to understand and apply the concepts of dependency mocking, testing Node modules, and testing asynchronous functionality.
